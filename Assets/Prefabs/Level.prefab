    sentences:
    - 1Hey, how are you? Are you new here?
    - 2Great! Yes, I am a freshman.
    - "1I\u2019m Cookie, I\u2019m an Art major here. Are you ready for finals?"
    - "2No, I am very nervous for all of my classes.\r"
    - "1Dang dude, I feel that. Know what I heard the other day?\r"
    - "2What?\r"
    - "1I heard an upperclassman talking about this guy, Marcus, who disappeared
      right before graduation last year. \r"
    - "Apparently he was failing all of his classes so he needed to do well on all
      the rest of his tests in order to keep playing tennis. \r"
    - "So every night at 10 pm he would leave his dorm and go study and come back
      to his dorm room at 2 am. \r"
    - "Until one night he came back at midnight instead. \r"
    - "His roommates asked him why he isn\u2019t still studying and he told them
      that he was prepared for all of his tests the next week. \r\n"
    - 'He started to ace all of his exams and never went out studying again. '
    - 'Finally his roommates asked him how he was all of a sudden doing well in all
      of his classes.

'
    - "He told them that he had a really good tutor. \r"
    - "His friends didn\u2019t believe him but decided to let it go. \r"
    - "A week later, he disappeared but left a note in his dorm room. \r"
    - "He wrote that he found a mystical study guide that gives anyone who uses it
      straight A\u2019s. \r\n"
    - "At first it seemed like a great tool, but soon both professors and students
      started to ask him how he got so smart so fast. \r\n"
    - "He knew he couldn\u2019t show anyone the study guide because everyone would
      want it and fight over it. \r"
    - 'He got so overwhelmed by all of this he decided to hide the study guide somewhere
      on campus and then leave. '
    - "His roommates searched their dorm room and everywhere else on campus they
      thought it could be, but they never found it. \r\n"
    - "They went on to graduate last spring and the mystical study guide is still
      never to be found.\r"
    - "2Woah, that\u2019s crazy. I would love to find that.\r"
    - "1Yeah, me too. Anyways I got to go, see ya around\r"
    - 2See ya
    - "2\u201DHuh, nobody has found the study guide after all these years? That thing
      could be really useful. I wonder if anyone else around here knows anything
      about it.\u201D"
